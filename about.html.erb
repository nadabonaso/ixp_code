            The iX founders were both incredibly grateful for their Yale undergraduate experience, but felt something was fundamentally lacking from their time on campus. They were high on theory, but low on skills, and the material they had learned was already outdated by graduation. They dreamed of creating a university that prepared students for the future, inspired pupils to challenge themselves and for them to be pushed out of their comfort zones.
