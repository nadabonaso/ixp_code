# iXP Code Examples
I have added some examples of Embedded Ruby HTML pages that I created while working with iXperience. The pages are for the main content only and doesn't include header or footer elements. The app was built in Ruby on Rails and hosted on Heroku.

They have since migrated over to using WebFlow so the pages are not live in the same format any longer.

I worked alongside the developers to convert UI designs into webpages for https://ixperience.co/
